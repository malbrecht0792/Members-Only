<h1>Members Only</h1>

This project features an exclusive clubhouse where members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

This is a demonstration of "rolling your own" authentication system, very similar to the sample app tutorial. It focuses on data and function, not style.
